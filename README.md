Have a bar to suggest? [File an issue](https://github.com/CocktailStandards/CocktailStandards.github.io/issues/new).

Only exceptional cocktail bars will be added; we're looking for something special, whether it be craft cocktails, molecular mixology or something entirely different. The idea here is "what are the 2-3 places that you **must** go to in this town?" 

Listings are just a name and a link, up to four descriptive words (no more), and optionally any of the listed symbols.

Self-promotion from bar owners will result in a permanent ban. 

All submissions are made under the same license as Cocktail Standards.

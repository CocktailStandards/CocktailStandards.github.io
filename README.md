title: Cocktail Standards Submissions
---

We happily take pull requests on
[github](http://github.com/CocktailStandards/CocktailStandards.github.io).

Only exceptional cocktail bars will be added; we're looking for something
special, whether it be craft cocktails, molecular mixology or something
entirely different.

Listings are just a name and a link, up to four descriptive words (no more),
and optionally any of the listed symbols.

Self-promotion from bar owners will result in a permanent ban. 

All submissions are made under the same license as Cocktail Standards.
